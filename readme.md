# Digital Circuit Design Lab
- These are the experiments that are to be implemented in Verilog in the Lab

Currently the repository houses the following experiments

#### Misc
- four_one_mux
- eight_three_encoder
- two_four_decoder
- sixteen_one_mux
- parity_generator_checker

#### Adders
- full_adder
- full_subtractor
- carry_look_ahead_adder_4_bit
- full_adder_8_bit_with_rca_4
- carry_select_adder_8_bit
- ripple_carry_adder_4_bit


# Format Followed
- Use a file name with a small name that can convey or abbreviate the meaning of the experiment
- Prefix with tb_ to indicate test bench.
- Files that are required as dependencies must be added to the folder, all modules except the main module must be in this file.
- Add jpg image of RTL and waveform with same name as the main file, suffix with rtl for RTL schematic image.
- Make sure to change the background of the waveform to white and text to black before taking the screenshots.
